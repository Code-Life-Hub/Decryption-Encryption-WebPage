# Decryption-Encryption-WebPage

This is a web application that provides tools for encoding and decoding messages using various ciphers. 

## Features

- **Caesar Shift**: This tool implements the Caesar Shift, a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order.

- **Polybius Square**: This tool implements the Polybius Square cipher, which is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. For example, in the above table, the letter "B" would be represented by the numerical pair "21".

- **Substitution Cipher**: This tool implements the Substitution Cipher, which requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the standard alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the substitution alphabet, otherwise it will be difficult for them to decode the message.
